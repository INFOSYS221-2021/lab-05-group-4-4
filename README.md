### Exercise One: Reversing String
Complete the simple program in Exercise01.java that given a word or a sentence, return the given word/sentence in reverse order.

### Exercise Two: Fibonacci Sequence
Complete the simple program in exercise02.py that finds the value at the nth position in the Fibonacci sequence. A Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers, where the next number is the sum of the previous numbers. For example, if n is 6, then the value is 8 (the Fibonacci sequence is 1,1,2,3,5,8.

### Exercise Three: Count Digits
Complete the simple program in exercise03.py that given an integer value, find the number of digits the given value has. For negative values, only count the digits, not the negative sign. For example, given an integer value of 100, the number of digits is three.

#ANSWER
a_integer = (abs(-100))
b_string = str(a_integer)
length = len(b_string)
print(length)


### Exercise Four: String Palindrome
Modify the simple program in Exercise01.java to determine if a given String is palindrome or not. A String is palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. For example, dad is a palindrome. You should ignore all cases and spaces in the String.

Hint: Reuse the code written in Exercise One.
